# YouTube-TinyMCE4
A YouTube 'search and insert' plugin updated for TinyMCE4

This plugin integrates with the YouTube API; allowing direct browsing of YouTube videos directly from the TinyMCE console.

Browse YouTube videos, watch an embedded preview to ensure the video is the correct one, configure a few options, and insert directly into the tinymce element.

To install copy the extracted "youTube" folder into the tinymce/plugins directory. Then, add "youTube" to both the 'toolbar' and the 'plugins' tinymce initialization process.

PS: you can use this with ASP.NET (all versions)
